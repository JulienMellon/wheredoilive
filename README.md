# A new project

So sometimes there are Rats in my neighborhood and sometimes my neighbors complain about it to the city.  the city (New York City) has an open dataset that includes a date and time of a rat sighting, and the latitude-longitude of the reported sighting

I've always wondered, how many times have people complained in the past... 6 months?  1 year? about rats within a half mile of my home ( or your mom's home if its in nyc)

so here I am building this from the very beginning

the first commit is nothing but an html file and this readme

## Where Am I?

I'd love to show you how many rat sightings there are near me, but first, i have to figure out how to convert your address into a latitude and longitude so it can be compared to the dataset.

I've heard the Google Maps API might be a good choice for this, so let's start by building something where you enter your address and it shows a latitude and longitude.  sounds like a place to start, eh?

### next up (maybe):  where are the rats?
